
version 0.6.0
- measurement in covariates model component mec() added
- new function pr_gig to specify a Generalized Inverse Gaussian prior
- new argument logJacobian for create_sampler to allow comparisons of
  information criteria between model fits based on different transformations
- added function to set labels of draws component object
- data is now second argument of create_sampler and generate_data functions,
  in line with many model fitting functions in R
- generate_data gains argument linpred, which is convenient for generating
  both data and latent quantities of interest for area-level models
- solved a bug in function split_iters
- print.dc_summary now correctly handles max.lines argument
- adapted to new version of Matrix package
- more input checks and small code improvements
