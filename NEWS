
version 0.7.2
- prediction for new data now handles out-of-sample random effects (at least
  for iid random effect terms), so that it becomes easier to account for
  cluster effects from cluster samples, say
- several other small improvements to predict method
- small fix in preparation for upcoming Matrix 1.5-4 (thanks to Mikael Jagan)
- model_matrix: allow single-level factor/character variables if no contrasts
  are applied
- bug fix: inequality constraints did not work in combination with blocked
  Gibbs sampler
- some parts of truncated multivariate normal samplers have been converted
  to C++ (using Rcpp and RcppEigen) for better performance
- argument sampler of computeDesignMatrix has been removed
- to_draws_array can now also convert an mcdraws object (or a subset of
  components from it) to a draws_array object for further analysis using
  R package posterior


version 0.7.1
- compute_WAIC can now run using multiple cores
- predict method with option ppcheck=TRUE now also works in parallel
- prepare for coercion deprecations in upcoming version of Matrix package


version 0.7.0
- renamed class 'draws' to 'mcdraws' to avoid name clash with R package
  posterior
- added function to_draws_array to convert a draws component to an object of
  class draws_array, as defined in R package posterior
- support for multinomial family
- support for Poisson family, approximately, in terms of negative binomial
- it is now possible to use weights to specify irregularly spaced AR1 or RW1
  correlation structures
- initial support for conjugate gradient coefficient sampler
- experimental function for simulation-based calibration


version 0.6.0
- measurement in covariates model component mec() added
- new function pr_gig to specify a Generalized Inverse Gaussian prior
- new argument logJacobian for create_sampler to allow comparisons of
  information criteria between model fits based on different transformations
- added function to set labels of draws component object
- data is now second argument of create_sampler and generate_data functions,
  in line with many model fitting functions in R
- generate_data gains argument linpred, which is convenient for generating
  both data and latent quantities of interest for area-level models
- solved a bug in function split_iters
- print.dc_summary now correctly handles max.lines argument
- adapted to new version of Matrix package
- more input checks and small code improvements


version 0.5.0
- initial CRAN release
